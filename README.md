## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to create a story in Tableau Public to pitch to Des Moines bikesharing stakeholders. Various factors such as trip duration, gender breakdown, and starting points were visualized.

### Trips by weekday for each hour

The primary usage hours are in the moning and afternoon, suggesting that NYC citi bikes are used for work commutes. 

### Checkout Times for Users

The vast majority of citi bike users have trips lasting under half an hour, allowing for high turn-around of bikes. A Des Moines bike service could be cognizant of neighborhoods that are in close proximity to working centers. 

### Gender Variance of Ride Times

A Des Moines bikesharing service could differ (and be more sucessful) from NY Citi bikes by reaching new groups, such as women. 

### Gender Breakdown

Currently, Men make up more than half of NY citi bike sharing users. 

### Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)

Despite the gender differences, men and women use bikes for similar purposes and similar times. 

### Trips by Gender per Weekday (Customers vs Subscibers)

Opening up the subscriber base to more women would allow a Des Moines bikesharing service to be sucessful. 

### Starting Locations

If we pivot towards acquiring more subscribers, a thorough knowledge of high-traffic trourist and work locations would be necessary. 

## Summary 
Given NYC bike user data, a Des Moines bike sharing service could succeed by taking into account what has been learned. Additionally, knowing the age of users across all users as well as by data could be helpful.

NOTE: A large amount of users born in 1970 report as unknown, which could represent a flaw in the customer sign in for non-subscribed citi bike users.
